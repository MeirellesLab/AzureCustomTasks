Get started with Azure Batch by using the Python API to run an Azure Batch job from an app. The app uploads input data files to Azure Storage and creates a pool of Batch compute nodes (virtual machines). It then creates a job that runs tasks to process each input file in the pool using a basic command.

After completing this quickstart, you'll understand key concepts of the Batch service and be ready to try Batch with more realistic workloads at larger scale.
